## What this is

Q-Alpha — a quantitative wealth-management system for Indian (NSE/BSE) equities. The full system
architecture is specified in [Q_alpha.md](Q_alpha.md) (v3.1). The codebase is built **phase by
phase**; the spec mandates that **Phase 0 (strategy validation by backtest) must beat baselines
after costs and taxes before any production infrastructure is built**.

**Current state: Phase 0** — a walk-forward backtest that answers one question: does the
six-factor → sector-allocator → min-variance strategy beat do-nothing, Nifty 50, a SIP, and
equal-weight, **net of realistic Zerodha costs and Indian capital-gains taxes**, with no look-ahead
and no survivorship bias? No DB / broker / dashboard exists yet — all gated behind a GO verdict.

## Key decisions (deviations from the spec, deliberate)

- **Broker = Zerodha (Kite Connect), not HDFC.** Notably ₹0 delivery brokerage, which changes the
  cost-gate math. Cost constants live in `src/qalpha/accounting/costs.py`.
- **Tax-aware optimizer** (`run_backtest(tax_aware=True)`): the spec's §4.6 net-benefit gate done
  properly — a rebalance is suppressed unless its annual risk reduction (₹) beats 2× its real
  cost + FIFO capital-gains tax. This is the core edge: friction is modelled *inside* the decision,
  not bolted on. It turned a NO-GO (5.4% CAGR, taxed to death) into beating Nifty 50 net (14.6%).
- The **accounting engine** (`src/qalpha/accounting/`) is standalone so the future live decision
  engine reuses the exact same FIFO/cost/tax code.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync --extra dev                       # set up venv + deps
uv run pytest                             # tests (must stay green)
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .   # lint + format
uv run mypy src                           # strict type-check
uv run python scripts/run_phase0.py       # run the backtest + print go/no-go report
uv run python -m qalpha.data.ingest --tickers TCS INFY --start 2012-01-01   # pull prices
uv run python -m qalpha.data.fundamentals --raw data/fundamentals/raw       # ingest Screener xlsx
```

All four gates (ruff, ruff-format, mypy strict, pytest) must pass before committing.

## Architecture (the funnel)

```
data/         price panel (yfinance→Parquet), point-in-time universe, Screener fundamentals
factors/      momentum, volatility, liquidity (0a) + value, quality, dividend (0b); regime; scoring
alloc/        Ledoit-Wolf+EWMA covariance conditioning → scipy sector allocator → scipy optimizer
accounting/   FIFO tax lots + Zerodha costs + capital-gains tax   (reused by the future live system)
backtest/     walk-forward engine, portfolio accountant, baselines, metrics, go/no-go report
config.py     every tunable parameter (Q_alpha.md §16) in one place
```

Data flow each rebalance: `as_of` slice (no look-ahead) → liquidity gate → factor scores under the
regime's weights → top-N selection → sector allocator → portfolio optimizer → tax-aware execution.

## Conventions

- **Money is `decimal.Decimal`** everywhere it touches accounting; never float (spec §5.2). Factor
  / covariance math uses numpy float64.
- **No look-ahead, ever.** All historical reads go through `PriceData.as_of(date)`; fundamentals
  carry an `effective_date = report_date + 90d` lag. There is a test that fails on look-ahead.
- **Reuse before adding.** The sector-percentile ranker, cost engine, and FIFO ledger are shared;
  prefer extending them. Match the surrounding style; keep functions typed (mypy strict).
- Reference the spec by section (e.g. "§4.6") in comments so code maps back to the architecture.
- Phase 0a (3 price/volume factors) runs without fundamentals; Phase 0b (6 factors) activates when
  Screener exports are present in `data/fundamentals/raw/`. The scorer renormalises over whatever
  factors exist, so the same code path serves both.

## Honest open items (don't paper over these)

- Universe is currently a **static large-cap watchlist** → survivorship bias; verdict is capped at
  CONDITIONAL until a point-in-time NSE index membership is sourced.
- Cost model uses **flat 0.2% slippage** — fine at ₹2L, but must become size-aware (slippage ∝
  order/ADV) before the ₹50L+ scaling numbers are trustworthy (spec §13).
- Benchmark is the Nifty 50 *price* index, not the Total-Return index; use TRI in calibration.
- Do **not** auto-tune parameters to manufacture a GO — that defeats the purpose of Phase 0.
